This terraform module automate the backup of data across AWS services using a resource tag.

The following resources will be created:
 - An Identity and Access Management (IAM) that Provides AWS Backup permissions to create backups of all supported resource types on your behalf.
 - AWS Backup - It is a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate the backup of data across AWS services
 - AWS Vault - Backup vaults are containers where your backups are stored. You can have one default vault, or multiple vaults to backup to.
 - AWS Backup plan - Backup rules specify the backup schedule, backup window, and lifecycle rules.
     - The amount of time AWS Backup attempts a backup before canceling the job and returning an error
        - The default value is 120
     - The number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold storage
        - The default value is 30
     - The number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted. Must be 90 days greater than cold storage
        - The default value is 120
     - The amount of time in minutes before beginning a backup
        - The default value is 60
     - A cron specifying when AWS Backup initiates a backup job
